# COMP-2210-SPRING-2020
Here lies the ashes of my hopes and dreams...I mean my progamming homework from a past semester. 
Inside this repo, you'll find the hands-on, practice test PDFs, and projects to help you get through this class.
Project average is 100%. No failed test cases. I'll come through later and update the documentation 
that explains the methods a bit better. Since there are seemingly infinite ways to complete each project,
my advice to you is to comb through the Java API to learn new methods that you didn't know you can call on.
Don't be a code thief.  You won't be able to pass any Hackerrack assessments if you don't learn anything.
